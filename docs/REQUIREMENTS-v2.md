## Refined Requirements
# Technical Specification: "Visit Mongolia" - Iteration 2

## 1. Project Overview
The goal of this iteration is to provide a robust, production-ready landing page for "Visit Mongolia." To address recurring deployment pipeline failures ("No prototype deployed"), the architecture will shift to a **monolithic, self-contained `index.html`** at the project root. This ensures the deployment engine finds a valid entry point immediately without complex build steps.

**Core Vision:** A visually stunning, responsive single-page application (SPA) that introduces users to the landscapes, culture, and travel opportunities in Mongolia.

---

## 2. Technical Strategy
*   **Architecture:** Single-file deployment.
*   **Entry Point:** `/index.html` (Root directory).
*   **Assets:** 
    *   **CSS:** Inlined within `<style>` tags in the `<head>`.
    *   **JS:** Inlined within `<script>` tags before the closing `</body>`.
    *   **Images:** High-quality external CDN links (Unsplash) to keep the file size manageable.
*   **Frameworks:** Vanilla HTML5, CSS3 (Flex/Grid), and modern ES6+ JavaScript.

## 6. Implementation Plan (Iteration 2 Priorities)

1.  **Critical Path:** Create `/index.html` at root and move all logic from `src/` into this file to resolve the "Missing Artifact" error.
2.  **Styling:** Implement the CSS Grid for the "Vastness" section and the Blue/Red/Gold color palette.
3.  **Content:** Add curated text descriptions for the Gobi, Altai, and Khovsgol regions.
4.  **Optimization:** Minify the inline CSS/JS manually (if possible) or ensure it is highly organized for easy future extraction.
5.  **Validation:** Test the file by opening it directly in a browser without a build server to ensure total self-sufficiency.

## Acceptance Criteria
- All features must be fully implemented (no placeholders)
- UI must be responsive and accessible
- Error handling must be comprehensive
- Code must pass TypeScript compilation

## Iteration 1

## Insights & Optimizations

### 1. Optimization: Optimization Instruction: Generate a fully functional, self-contained `index.html` file in the root directory with inline CSS and JS, ensuring the deployment pipeline detects a valid entry point to resolve the missing artifact error.

### 2. Optimization: Generate a fully functional `index.html` entry point in the project root, ensuring it contains the complete DOM structure, styles, and logic required to guarantee the deployment pipeline detects and serves a renderable prototype.

### 3. Loop Analysis: The same error "No prototype deployed..." has occurred 3 times. Previous optimization strategies are not addressing the root cause.

### 4. Optimization: Optimization Instruction: "Initialize the project with a valid `index.html` entry point in the root directory that explicitly links to and mounts the main application script, ensuring the UI renders immediately to satisfy the deployment verification check."

### 5. Optimization: **Optimization Instruction:** Initialize the project file structure with a valid `index.html` entry point at the root level to ensure the hosting environment detects, builds, and serves the prototype successfully.

### 6. Loop Analysis: The same error "No prototype deployed..." has occurred 3 times. Previous optimization strategies are not addressing the root cause.

## Iteration 1

## Insights & Optimizations

### 1. Optimization: Optimization Instruction: Generate a fully functional, self-contained `index.html` file in the root directory with inline CSS and JS, ensuring the deployment pipeline detects a valid entry point to resolve the missing artifact error.

### 2. Optimization: Generate a fully functional `index.html` entry point in the project root, ensuring it contains the complete DOM structure, styles, and logic required to guarantee the deployment pipeline detects and serves a renderable prototype.

### 3. Loop Analysis: The same error "No prototype deployed..." has occurred 3 times. Previous optimization strategies are not addressing the root cause.
